## Bio

I am a Ph.D. student at [Tennessee Tech](https://www.tntech.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php) with an emphasis of Cybersecurity and have been appointed as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Cybersecurity Education, Research & Outreach Center (CEROC)](https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/). Prior starting my Ph.D. program, I served at [Appinion BD Ltd.](http://www.appinionbd.com/), an evolving software development company in Dhaka, as a Software Project Manager for over one year and half after completing my undergrad program from [American International University-Bangladesh](http://www.aiub.edu/) majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.

At CEROC, I am working with [Prof. Dr. Ambareen Siraj](http://users.csc.tntech.edu/~asiraj/) and am privileged to solve important, real-world cybersecurity problems. Having the quality of an independent researcher, I recognize and define a problem on the field of malware detection, e.g., ransomware, malicious domain names, etc., formulate a technique or methodology to solve that defined problem, and evaluate the findings and solution.

My research work also broadly coincides with Machine Learning. Apart from research, I participate in Defense, Offense, and Capture The Flag Cyber Interest Group at Tennessee Tech to make ourselves competent and ready for the ever growing field of cybersecurity. In my pastime, I primarily exercise ad-hoc problems in competitive programming environment.
