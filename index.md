## Bio

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php) at [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/) with an emphasis of Cybersecurity and have been working at [Cybersecurity Education, Research & Outreach Center (CEROC)](https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/) as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ambareen Siraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambareensiraj/).

At CEROC, I mainly conduct research in the domain of Malware Analysis where I aim to solve important, real-world challenges that involve identification, protection, detection, and recovery from malware by incorporating Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other techniques as per requirement.

Aside from research, I enjoy learning industry standards of (Secure) Software Development as well as state-of-the-art (academia and industry) practices of Data Science and Machine Learning, participating competitive programming challenges primarily under the category of Algorithm and Data Structure using C / C++, and involving in outreach / (voluntary) leadership activities.
